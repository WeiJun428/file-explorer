# Browser

## Introduction
Browser is a PDF nagivation tool dedicated to help users to browse and open PDF easily.

Using Browser, users can:

- Set the address of root folder in setting using predefined password
- Navigate between folders by clicking link on the top navigation bar
- Filter folders and files in the current folder using the top search bar
- Open Folder or PDF by clicking the relative card
- Use the scroll-to-top button to navigate to the top of fodler easily

## Technologies
I use HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, ElectronJS, NodeJS (fs, path, shell) to create this native application. I use these web technologies instead of using .NET, C++, or Java to utilize its advanced and customized UI ability.

## Extra Features

1. The most recent PDF that the user opens will be shown on the homepage so that the user does not need to navigate down to the subfolder again.
2. Feel free to suggest one by emailing the [developer](wj428@uw.edu)
